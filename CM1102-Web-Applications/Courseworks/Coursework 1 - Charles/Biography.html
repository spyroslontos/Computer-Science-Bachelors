<p>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, philosopher
    and inventor born on December 26, 1791, in London, England.
    Often called “The Father of Computing,” Babbage detailed
    plans for mechanical Calculating Engines, Difference Engines,
    and Analytical Engines.
    Babbage died on October 18, 1871, in London.

    The 1820s saw Babbage work on his 'Difference Engine', a machine
    which could perform mathematical calculations. A six-wheeled model
    was initially constructed and demonstrated to a number of audiences.
    He then developed plans for a bigger, better, machine - Difference
    Engine 2. He also worked on another invention, the more complex Analytical
    Engine, a revolutionary device on which his fame as a computer pioneer now
    largely rests. It was intended to be able to perform any arithmetical
    calculation using punched cards that would deliver the instructions,
    as well as a memory unit to store numbers and many other fundamental
    components of today's computers. The remarkable British mathematician
    Ada Lovelace completed a program for the Analytical Engine but neither
    it, nor Difference Engine 2, were finished in Babbage's lifetime.
