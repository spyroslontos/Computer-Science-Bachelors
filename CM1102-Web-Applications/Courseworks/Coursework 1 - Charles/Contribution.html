    The Difference Engine could compute simple calculations,
    like multiplication or addition, but its most important
    trait was its ability create tables of the results of up
    to seven-degree polynomial functions. His engine, except
    for the printing mechanism, was close to being finished
    in 1832, but funds to complete the project were dropped,
    and so had to be his project. By 1837, Babbage had come
    up with a new idea: a computer that could understand commands
    and could be programmed much like a modern-day computer.
    He called it the Analytical Engine, and it was the first
    machine ever designed with the idea of programming. Babbage
    started working on this engine when work on his Difference
    Engine was halted and continued for most of his life.
    Unfortunately, due mostly to political and economic concerns,
    and of course to the high technological involvement of the
    project, Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine was never completed.
    His ideas were isolated at the time, and no other attempts
    at building such a computer were thought of again until well
    into the next century. Babbage, a true computer pioneer, is
    known as the "Father" of computers, due to his early, but
    isolated contributions to the field.

    The Difference Engine, was partially completed
    in the early 1830s, but never to the extent he had planned.
    The Analytical Engine, his second and more complex design
    was never completed at all, but both had the potential to
    be very powerful, especially for the time period.
