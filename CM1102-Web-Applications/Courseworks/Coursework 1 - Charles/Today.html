  No version of an analytical engine was ever completed.
  Despite the failure to realize his ultimate dream,
  Babbage's plans alone distinguish himself as a man ahead
  of the times. He was almost too ahead of his times, as his
  plans didn't spark any more development in the field, but
  the innovations are nonetheless remarkable, and stand as
  an inspiration to computer visionaries today.

    It was not until almost 160 years later that Babbage's
    "second difference engine" was finally manufactured.
    The first working version of this machine was built by
    the Science Museum in London, for the Babbage bicentenary
    in 1991. It can now be seen at the  Museum; a second
    machine was then built for an American high-tech millionnaire,
    who put it in the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View,
    California. Babbage's analytical engines would have used
    "programmes" like those used in the textile industry to
    make complicated patterns; but they were never built.
