<h2>Watching the Telly</h2>
<p>Perhaps my main interest is watching television.
It's very relaxing, and the TV-license costs less than Â£0.50 per day.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>
<p>Almost as interesting as watching the telly is sleeping. It can take many forms, ranging from the nodding off to the deep and complex dream infested sleep.</p>
